# ginsu

Ginsu provides lightweight data warehousing for Java programmers.

You describe a data warehouse with a small bit fo code and ginsu builds it for you: tables, views, indexes, surrogate keys, the works.
Then you write some ETL code to populate the warehouse via a simple key-value interface.
